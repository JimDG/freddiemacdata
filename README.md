**transformation of the freddie mac data to The Profit Table's standard data dictionary**

#### Background

As part of a larger effort to increase transparency, Freddie Mac is making available loan-level credit performance data on a portion of fully amortizing fixed-rate mortgages that the company purchased or guaranteed from 1999 to 2016.

You can get more information around the data set, as well as the user manual and actual download [here](http://www.freddiemac.com/research/datasets/sf_loanlevel_dataset.html). 

#### Scope

The scope of this repo is to convert the Freddi Mac data to the standard format used by The Profit Table for loan analysis in all of our packages. Please see [this repo](https://github.com/TheProfitTable/masterlibrary/blob/master) for the data dictionary. You can also acces our style guide and on boarding information there.
